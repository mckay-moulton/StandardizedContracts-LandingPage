            <!-- Text -->
            <p>
              Most contracts are made up of provisions that rarely change. The
              names of the parties, the pricing, and the length of the term may
              change, but the rest will likely stay the same. However, when you
              get a new contract from a company you don’t know yet, you still
              need to have your attorney read through the entire contract to be
              sure the other side didn’t slip in anything unfair or unexpected.
            </p>
            <p>
              When she reads through that contract, your attorney will likely
              feel like she needs to change some things in your favor, so that
              she can prove her value. After those changes, the attorneys will
              likely go back and forth until they reach a reasonable middle
              ground that is acceptable to both sides.
            </p>
            <p>
              The whole process will likely cost you and your business contact
              thousands of dollars, depending on the tenacity and stubbornness
              of your attorneys.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              But why can’t we start out with a contract that is already fair to
              both sides? Then the attorneys could just read through the
              contract once, knowing that it was drafted by an unbiased party
              with fairness as the principal goal. Negotiations on the legal
              boilerplate would be drastically reduced on your first contract,
              and on following contracts, they would be eliminated entirely. The
              only negotiations would be on the pricing and other terms that are
              specific to each contract.

            <!-- Text -->
            <p>
              We have been drafting and negotiating commercial contracts for
              decades, and we know how all the haggling usually ends. It’s
              amazing how almost all contracts that are negotiated by good
              lawyers end up with the same basic provisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we’ve written “standardized contracts” that we offer as
              templates for our customers. By starting out with a fair
              standardized contract, our customers avoid the necessity of paying
              lawyers to read through every new contract. Instead, they have
              their lawyers read through the template and recommend changes, and
              then our customers issue an invitation to their business contacts
              with the revisions called out.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              If the other side has already used Standardized Contracts, they
              don’t even need to read through the contract. They can just review
              the revisions and can either accept them or propose changes. If
              they need to make other changes, they can also propose those other
              changes.

            <!-- Text -->
            <p>
              When you want to invite one of your business contacts to enter
              into a Standardized Contract with you, you will first go to
              <a href="https://StandardizedContracts.com"></a>
                StandardizedContracts.com</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you’ve selected the template you want to use, you’ll begin
              filling in the contact information for the parties, such as names,
              email addresses, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then you’ll get to the Basic Agreement Information, where you’ll
              choose terms that are specific to your contract, such as the
              length of the term of your contract and the pricing for your
              services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you review those items and click “Next,” you’ll go to a page
              where you can type in Variations you want to make to the template
              form. Variations are changes you make to terms that typically do
              not change. For example, a non-disclosure agreement will typically
              have an exception for information that is required to be disclosed
              by court order, but if you don’t want to have an exception for
              court-ordered disclosures, you can reference the section number
              where you want to make a change and type in the change in the
              field provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you’ve entered any Variations, you’ll review everything, sign
              the form, and enter your credit card information. Your business
              contact will receive an email notifying her that you have issued a
              Standardized Contract.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once your business contact clicks on the link she receives, she
              will be taken to your proposed contract on
              <a href="https://StandardizedContracts.com"
                >StandardizedContracts.com</a
              >, where she will be able to review the standardized template and
              your changes. She can then accept or reject your changes, and even
              make changes of her own.
            </p>
            <p>
              If she agrees to all of the terms you have proposed, she can
              simply sign where indicated and accept the contract. Since you’ve
              already signed on your side, once your business contact accepts
              and signs, you have a binding contract!
            </p>

            <p class="mb-0">
              If your business contact doesn’t agree to your terms exactly, then
              you will receive an email indicating that you’ve received a
              counter-offer. You can then go to the contract and repeat the
              process. Once you’ve both agreed to all the terms and signed the
              contract, you’ll each get a congratulatory email that attaches the
              signed agreement and the template form.

              As you can guess, once you start using Standardized Contracts, a
              world of new opportunities will open up to you. For example, in
              future versions of our services, you’ll be able to index and
              search your contracts for provisions that may be important to you
              in future years. For example, if you ever decide to sell your
              business and need to know which of your contracts are assignable,
              you’ll be easily able to check the assignment terms to see when
              Variations to the assignment section were made.
            </p>
            <p>
              Indexing the other information in your standardized contracts will
              also allow you to easily retrieve other important information such
              as payment due dates, termination dates, option exercise periods,
              insurance requirements, and the like.

              take advantage of our negotiation tool, we can do that too. The
              template won’t be “standardized,” but the process will, and your
              business contacts will love you for it.
